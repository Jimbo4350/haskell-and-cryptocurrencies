-- The 'BinTree' type is suitable for representing
-- "binary search trees".
--
-- Binary search trees are trees that store their elements
-- in order, so that we can efficiently find elements by comparing
-- the element we are looking for with the current node, and
-- descending either left or right.
--
-- Define a function 'isBST' that checks if a given 'BinTree'
-- is a binary search tree.

-- Task HigherOrder-5.
--
-- Define a function 'search' that looks up a value in a BST.

-- From now on, we use a type synonym to signal that a certain
-- binary tree should in fact be a binary search tree, even if
-- the type system does not actively enforce this.

-- Task HigherOrder-6.
--
-- Define a function 'insert' that inserts a value into a BST
-- while maintaining the BST property. (Don't worry about balancing
-- the tree. That's not important for now. But do make sure you
-- maintain the BST property itself.)

-- Task HigherOrder-7.

-- Define the function 'all' (as in the Prelude) using 'foldr'.
-- Hide the original binding from the Prelude by exluding it in

--
-- Import the function 'sortyBy' from the 'Data.List' module.
-- Then use this function to define a function that sorts a
-- list in descending rather than ascending order.

-- Use 'insert' and 'foldr' to create a BST from a list.

-- Task HigherOrder-10.
--
-- We want to attach unique numbers to each node in a binary
-- tree, so that all the numbers from left to right are labelled
-- in ascending order.
--
-- NOTE: This is not easy. Think about this and discuss your
-- strategy with us before you proceed.

labelTree :: BinTree a -> BinTree (a, Int)
labelTree = error "TODO: define labelTree"

-- Task HigherOrder-11.
--
-- Another form of tree labeling does not use an integer, but
-- a label supply that is given as a list. So write a variant
-- of 'labelTree' that takes the labels from a list, but uses
-- every label only once. You may assume in this function that
-- the list contains infinitely many (or at least sufficiently
-- many) labels, so you don't have to return a 'Maybe' if the
-- list is too short, but can just crash.

labelTree' :: BinTree a -> [b] -> BinTree (a, b)
labelTree' = error "TODO: define labelTree'"

-- Task HigherOrder-12.
--
-- Define the catamorphism on 'BinTree'.
-- Also come up with the type signature yourself.
-- Look at functions such as 'mapBinTree' and 'search'
-- above for inspiration. Also try to
-- rewrite these in terms of the catamorphism once you
-- are done.

-- Task HigherOrder-13.
--
-- Try to implement the function 'take' on lists using 'foldr'.
--
-- Once again, this is not easy, and you should discuss your
-- ideas with us before trying.
--
-- Consider the type signature and a possible definition of
-- take, and note that not just the list is being traversed,
-- but also the number changes.

take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
take _ []       = []
take n (x : xs)
  | n > 0     = x : take (n - 1) xs
  | otherwise = []

-- Task HigherOrder-14.
--
-- If you succeeded in defining 'take' in terms of 'foldr',
-- then perhaps it will not surprise you all that much that
-- even 'foldl' can be written in terms of 'foldr'.
--
-- Try to do this. The approach required is similar.

-- Task HigherOrder-15.
--
-- Define a Foldable instance for binary trees.
-- For this, there are several methods, but the
-- easiest with our knowledge so far is to implement
-- a foldr function on trees.
-- For this, one option might be to first convert a
-- binary tree to a list.
